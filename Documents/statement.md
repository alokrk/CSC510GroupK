#Stack Overflow Recommendation System

Stack Overflow is used by over a million people. It is a store house of information related to all questions technology.
Be it programming paradigms, upcoming languages, design patterns or simple issues.

Although such a vast database ,we manage to find an answer to almost any query we have.
Yet, such a database is not being aggregated and put to use by proper aggregation.

We plan to create a recommender system to present data relevant to a user requirement.
For it to be presented in a form the user may find it useful not only for specific problems but also for knowledge discovery.
