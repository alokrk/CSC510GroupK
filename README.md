##March 1 Deliverables

Solution 1: n-gram<br />
Solution 2: Bayes Classifier<br />
Solution 3: Random Forest<br />

All three solutions have been coded in MATLAB. Inital idea was to code individual solution in MATLAB, R and Python and compare based on performance. But a user does not care about the performance at the backend, only the final output delivered. So, we decided on using MATLAB and expanded to three methods for classification.<br /> 
Dataset used is a subset to understand the model accuracy. Upon deciding on the final method, algorithm will be coded in R due to its better data handling capacit.y

Data frames for meta data have been completed in R. Normal data is being extracted and should be ready for implementation.

For content delivery, email forwarding system is being created. Along with the mail, we plan to add a feedback mechanism making it easier to collect feedback. A feedback form link can be embedded in the mail.

Accuracy for each method has been calculated. Based on this, we will implement the solution. Depending on the user feedback for the output, we can continue with the implemented solution or tweak it as per user requirement.
