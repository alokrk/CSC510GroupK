#Problem Statement Draft

##Stack Overflow Aggregation

Stack Overflow is used by over a million people. It is a store house of information related to all questions technology.
Be it programming paradigms, upcoming languages, design patterns or simple issues.

Although such a vast database, we manage to find an answer to almost any query we have.

Yet, such a database is not being aggregated and put to use by proper aggregation.
We can find solutions to our problems but not gain the latent knowledge.

We plan to create a tool to extract information from Stack Overflow to extract information relevant to a user requirement.
For it to be presented in a form the user may find it useful not only for specific problems but also for knowledge discovery.
